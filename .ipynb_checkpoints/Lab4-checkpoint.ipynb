(2) Remove any observations that having missing data. (3) Encode any string data as integers for now. (4) You have the option of keeping the \"county\" variable or removing it.

    "[.5 points] Balance the dataset so that about the same number of instances are within each class. Choose a method for balancing the dataset and explain your reasoning for selecting this method. One option is to choose quantization thresholds for the \"ChildPoverty\" variable that equally divide the data into four classes. Should balancing of the dataset be done for both the training and testing set? Explain.\n",
